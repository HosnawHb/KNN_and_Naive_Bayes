# KNN_and_Naive_Bayes
## Purpose
The Purpose of this project is to familiarize with the Na√Øve Bayes and K Nearest Neighbor classification methods. </br>
Algorithms related to these two methods were implemented and then trained and tested on the [Abalone](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone) dataset. </br>

## Description
Classification has been done on two features of the given dataset (sex and rings) </br>
The scikit-learn KNeighborsClassifier has been used for classification </br>
10-Fold Cross validation has been used in order to train and evaluate the categories </br>
The results for each round of training and testing, including precision and recall for each class, as well as overall accuracy has been reported </br>
